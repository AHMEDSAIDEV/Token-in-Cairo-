= Starknet Tooling

[NOTE]
====
To make the most of Starknet's development tools, you should have a basic grasp of the Cairo programming language. We suggest reading chapters 1-6 of the link:https://book.cairo-lang.org/title-page.html[Cairo Book], covering topics from 'Getting Started' to 'Enums and Pattern Matching.' Follow this by studying the link:https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch99-00-starknet-smart-contracts.html[Starknet Smart Contracts chapter] in the same book. With this background, you'll be well-equipped to understand the examples presented here.

We welcome contributors to enhance existing tools or develop new solutions.

This chapter explores the following:

* *Build* using Foundry or Hardhat
* *SDKs* for JavaScript, Python, Rust and Go
* *Frontend development* with Starknet.js and React
* *Testing methods* with Foundry and devnet

By chapter's end, you should have a complete grasp of Starknet's toolset, enabling efficient dApp development.

Here's a quick rundown of the tools that could be used for Starknet development and that we'll cover in this chapter:

. Scarb: A package manager that compiles your contracts.
. Starkli: A CLI tool for interacting with the Starknet network.
. Foundry: For contract testing.
. Katana: Creates a local test node.
. SDKs: starknet.js, Starknet.py, and starknet.rs interface with Starknet using common programming languages.
. Starknet-react: Builds front-end apps using React.
